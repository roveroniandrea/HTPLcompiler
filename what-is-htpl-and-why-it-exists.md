# What is HTPL and why it exists

### What can you do in HTPL?

HTPL supports lots of the basic feature required for a programming language. It allows you to declare variables, compute operations, assigning values, evaluating logical expressions, inserting conditions with an `if then else` structure, and supports the `while` loop construct. In addition to this, it provides interfaces for user inputs and program outputs via `prompt` and `alert` JS functions.

### Why using HTPL?

HTPL main purpose is to destoy the "HTML is not a programming language" meme, but you're able to make complex programs too, if you want.
