**It's known that HTML is not a programming language.** In fact it stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

No one could make a program in HTML.

**UNTIL NOW**

Welcome to the HTPLcompiler, a compiler that lets you program in HTML.

Ladies and gentleman, ~~we're~~ I'm proud to present you the **HTPL**, or **Hyper Text Programming Language**.

The compiler checks for all elements inside a defined element \(which is `<HTPL>`\) in body, and creates a `<script>` element containing JS code.
