# Getting started

### Get started - CLI \(WIP\)

If you want to use the new Htpl-CLI, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/roveroniandrea/HTPLcompiler/tree/master/Htpl-CLI)

### Get started - Browser

If you want to simply inject the compiler in your code, download `main.js` file and attach it in you `index.html` file. If you need some examples and introduction, continue reading or [try some examples](https://roveroniandrea.github.io/HTPLcompiler/).

HTPLCompiler interface can be found on your browser console, and provides you with an help\(\) function to get started.
